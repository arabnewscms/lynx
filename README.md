#### Package Name: Lynx
 

It was named after the lynx because of the excessive strength, smoothness of the face and the sharpening of the eyes, so I love this animal

#### Version : 1.0.0

This is the first beta version that was tested with the ^(8.*) version of Laravel Framework
#### Used For : generate api

It generates the API in one minute by simply inheriting the main controller and with a few methods. Easy, flexible and powerful that helps you improve output and input, deal with values, and upload files in the simplest form


#### compatibility with laravel version :  ^5.0,^6.0|^7.0|^8.0|^9.0 

In the plan, I want to make this package work with all versions, but currently it works on the eighth version only at the moment, and it is a trial version for a temporary period and when it is confirmed that all methods are suitable, an official version will be released

#### ŸêAuthor : Mahmoud Ibrahim


I have worked with many developers and companies
And I found that when a framework was built like Laravel, which built a unified method of construction that everyone could rely on

We also had to build a unified smart way for everyone and teams to work in an infrastructure for all backend developers
An easy way for front-end developers and mobile application developers to build a unified centralization in the use and circulation of data.
